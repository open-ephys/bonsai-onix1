    /// that holds information needed for communication between a host computer and ONI-compliant hardware.

    /// devices (e.g. headstages and their internal components) are currently connected, how
    /// often data should be read by the host computer, etc. <see cref="CreateContext"/> creates this required
    /// ONI context for a single ONIX system. The ONIX system that the context serves is uniquely identified
    /// within a host computer by the <see cref="Driver"/> used to communicate with hardware and the <see
    /// cref="Index"/>, which is a enumeration that is translated by the driver into a physical interface
    /// (e.g. a particular PCIe slot) within the host computer.
