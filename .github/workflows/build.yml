name: Build .NET and Publish to Nuget

# This workflow will run when: 1) any commit is pushed to main, 2) any pull request is opened that will merge to main, and 3) whenever a new release is published.
on:
  push:
    branches: [main] # 1) Generates a package on Github that is a pre-release package, and is typically named X.Y.Z-main-ci000, where X/Y/Z are the semantic version numbers, and ci000 is incremented for each action that is run, guaranteeing a unique package name
  pull_request:
    branches: [main] # 2) Does not generate a package, but does check that the semantic version number is increasing, and that the package builds correctly in all matrix configurations (Ubuntu / Windows and Release / Debug)
  release:
    types: [published] # 3) Generates a package that is a full release package (X.Y.Z) that is published to Github and NuGet automatically
